I run my server locally
database server: url: 'mongodb://localhost/test'

POST, PUT, and GET requests can also be tested with Postman app.

For example, you can send POST request to the URL input box: "localhost:8080/api/users" with x-www-form-url-encoded data of key: "name" type as " master" and "adddress" type as "234 scottsdale dr san jose" into users collection
